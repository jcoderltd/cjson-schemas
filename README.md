# CJSON Schemas

This repository is a helper repo to the main [cjson repo](https://github.com/jcoderltd/cjson) to publish the generated schemas in the `schema.cjson.dev` domain.

You can also use it to query/download the different published versions of the schemas.

Active development of the CJSON specification is driven via the main cjson repo linked above and the [documentation can be found here](https://docs.cjson.dev).
